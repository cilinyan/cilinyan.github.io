# 👋 About Me

I work at Xiaohongshu, 服务中心算法组 now in Beijing.

I graduated from [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/) with a master's degree, advised by Prof. [Guoliang Kang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P24HCsgAAAAJ). 
Before that, I received my B.S. degree at [Jilin University](https://jlu.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in the deep learning, computer vision, and multimodal.
